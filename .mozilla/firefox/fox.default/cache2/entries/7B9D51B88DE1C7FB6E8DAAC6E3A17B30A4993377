Thanks to this team&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s now much easier, faster, and more intuitive for employees to create and submit expense reports.</p>\n\n<p>Ask any employee who&rsquo;s been at Oracle more than a year, and he or she will tell you that expense reporting used to be quite the chore, especially if you had a lot of expenses to track and report.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a few highlights from a conversation with Winston from the Oracle@Oracle website and one of the many employees delighted by the new expense reporting experience, <a href=\"https://people.oracle.com/apex/f?p=8000:PERSON:221921531480::NO:RP,2:PERSON:cynthia.emmanuel\" target=\"_self\">Cynthia Emmanuel</a>, executive assistant, Enterprise IT, also featured on the website.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oracle@Oracle: How do you describe the work you do at Oracle?<br />\n<br />\nWinston: </b>We&rsquo;re working with our Product Management and Engineering colleagues to reinvent our products with automation, AI, machine learning, as well as gorgeous state-of-the-art systems. Together, this will transform our products elevating their quality, performance, impact, and customer satisfaction. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be here to help build the teams, processes, practices, and products that will deliver that vision.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cynthia:</b> I am an executive assistant at Oracle. I like to think of myself as a business partner who aids the smooth coordination of multiple fast-moving operations.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oracle@Oracle: How does Oracle&rsquo;s transformation impact you and your team?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Winston:</b> My team was charged with reimagining our expense reporting tool technology and process. The project was a joint effort with Product Management and Engineering to articulate what an &lsquo;automation forward&rsquo; product would look like. It&rsquo;s the first of many ERP application redesigns we aim to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>The goal was to automate if not eliminate as much tedious manual work as possible. In its place we designed a totally new kind of UX that&rsquo;s about controlling or working with automation.</p>\n\n<p>The workflow will be near touchless and the remaining work will be done with the help of a digital assistant conveniently accessed via a suite of clients, including chat, mobile web, and email.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cynthia: </b>I believe that my colleagues and I are probably the most affected by some of the transformations that have taken place. Our work has been massively affected by the changes to the expense reporting system, for example. It used to take us around 3 hours to enter an expense report in the old system, sometimes even more&mdash;believe it or not.</p>\n\n<p>With the launch of the new system and electronic submission of receipts, the time we spend on expenses has been dramatically cut down.</p>\n<b>Watch the 30-second video below to see Oracle&#39;s Expense Bot in action.</b><iframe allow=\"autoplay ; fullscreen ;

Oracle is also a leader in the 2019 <a href=\"https://go.oracle.com/LP=84658?elqCampaignId=220387&amp;src1=:so:bl:or::RC_PDMK190705P00033:Mflblog&amp;SC=:so:bl:or::RC_PDMK190705P00033:Mflblog&amp;pcode=PDMK190705P00033\" target=\"_self\">Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Financial Planning and Analysis Solutions</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>What does it mean to be a Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader?</b><br />\nAccording to the Gartner, &ldquo;Leaders provide mature offerings that meet market demand and have demonstrated the vision necessary to sustain their market position as requirements evolve. The hallmark of Leaders is that they focus on, and invest in, their offerings to the point where they lead the market and can affect its overall direction.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><b><img alt=\"\" src=\"[!--$CEC_DIGITAL_ASSET--]CONT7985D9B5495A4F3EB05F4B8FC977EDEC[/!--$CEC_DIGITAL_ASSET--]\" style=\"margin: 20px; float: left; width: 200px; height: 212px;\" />Why is being a Leader in both Gartner Magic Quadrants important to Oracle?</b><br />\n<a href=\"https://people.oracle.com/apex/f?p=8000:2:25294791953635::NO::PERSON_ID:564033113399104\" target=\"_self\">Juergen Lindner</a>, senior vice president, Oracle Cloud Business Group, says, &ldquo;This is an exciting validation of Oracle&rsquo;s EPM strategy and our larger applications strategy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He points out that the larger vision is to offer one complete &ldquo;connected suite&rdquo; of applications across all major business functions. &ldquo;Oracle EPM Cloud is the only complete and connected EPM suite offered on a common platform that addresses financial and operational planning, consolidation and close, master data management, reporting, and analysis.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Juergen adds that our leadership position in both Magic Quadrants demonstrates that Oracle EPM Cloud has &ldquo;both a breadth and depth of functionality that competitors can&rsquo;t match. Customers are looking to seamlessly connect their EPM processes, and we provide this capability out of the box; whereas competitors, such as OneStream or Anaplan, deliver monolithic solutions or process siloes that customers need to customize and integrate themselves.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, Juergen says that Oracle EPM Cloud has proven to be a &ldquo;very successful competitive wedge against these and other competitors, including SAP and Workday. It gives us a very strategic seat at the corporate table and allows for a great strategic corporate transformation overall with the entire Oracle Fusion Applications suite&mdash;a cloud partnership that others simply can&rsquo;t offer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><b>Spread the news with your social networks and customers </b><br />\nRead the <a
