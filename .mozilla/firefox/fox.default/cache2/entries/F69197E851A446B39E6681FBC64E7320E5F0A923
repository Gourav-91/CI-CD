about our Oracle transformation journey. Today, we&rsquo;re talking about how Oracle Cloud drove several dramatic results that delighted our employees, perhaps most noticeably improvements to the expense reporting experience.</p>\n\n<p><b>Meet Oracle change agents</b><br />\nOur <a href=\"https://stbeehive.oracle.com/content/dav/st/oracleatoracle/web/index.html\" target=\"_self\">Oracle@Oracle website</a> features employees across the business, who played a key role in taking our business to the cloud and transform our business from a service-oriented to customer-focused company.</p>\n\n<p>Visit the &ldquo;Meet the Transformers&rdquo; page to read a series of Q&amp;A interviews about these change agents discussing their strategy and accomplishments with customer success, SaaS provisioning, Corporate Finance Cloud Operations, and more.</p>\n\n<p>For this article, we&rsquo;re spotlighting <a href=\"https://people.oracle.com/apex/f?p=8000:2:221921531480::NO::PERSON_ID:195395423091678\" target=\"_self\">Winston Wang</a>, vice president, UX Design for finance and enterprise resource planning (ERP) products.</p>\n\n<p>Winston&rsquo;s team, led by <a href=\"https://people.oracle.com/apex/f?p=8000:2:15665516839778::NO::PERSON_ID:111835545302477\" target=\"_self\">Hillel Cooperman</a>, was charged with delivering a user experience for Oracle Cloud products that is not just as great as other enterprise software but &ldquo;every bit as good as the best consumer products as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><b>Dramatically improving the expense reporting experience</b><br />\nOne of the team&rsquo;s most dramatic success stories so far involves transforming the employee expense reporting experience. Thanks to this team&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s now much easier, faster, and more intuitive for employees to create and submit expense reports.</p>\n\n<p>Ask any employee who&rsquo;s been at Oracle more than a year, and he or she will tell you that expense reporting used to be quite the chore, especially if you had a lot of expenses to track and report.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a few highlights from a conversation with Winston from the Oracle@Oracle website and one of the many employees delighted by the new expense reporting experience, <a href=\"https://people.oracle.com/apex/f?p=8000:PERSON:221921531480::NO:RP,2:PERSON:cynthia.emmanuel\" target=\"_self\">Cynthia Emmanuel</a>, executive assistant, Enterprise IT, also featured on the website.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oracle@Oracle: How do you describe the work you do at Oracle?<br />\n<br />\nWinston: </b>We&rsquo;re working with our Product Management and Engineering colleagues to reinvent our products with automation, AI, machine learning, as well as gorgeous state-of-the-art systems. Together, this will transform our products elevating their quality, performance, impact, and customer satisfaction. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be here to help build the teams, processes, practices, and products that will deliver that vision.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cynthia:</b> I am an executive assistant at Oracle. I like to think of myself as a business partner who aids the smooth coordination of multiple fast-moving operations.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oracle@Oracle: How does Oracle&rsquo;s transformation impact you and your team?</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Winston:</b> My team was charged with reimagining our expense reporting tool technology and process. The project was a joint effort with Product Management and Engineering to articulate what an &lsquo;automation forward&rsquo; product would look like. It&rsquo;s the first of many ERP application redesigns we aim to deliver.</p>\n\n<p>The goal was to automate if not eliminate as much tedious manual work as possible. In its place we designed a totally new kind of UX that&rsquo;s about controlling or working with automation.</p>\n\n<p>The workflow will be near touchless and the remaining work will be done with the help of a digital assistant conveniently accessed via a suite of clients, including chat, mobile web, and email.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cynthia: </b>I believe that my colleagues and I are probably the most affected by some of the transformations that have taken place. Our work has been massively affected by the changes to the expense reporting system, for example. It used to take us around 3 hours to enter an expense report in the old system, sometimes even more&mdash;believe it or not.</p>\n\n<p>With the launch of the new system and electronic submission of receipts, the time we spend on expenses has been dramatically cut down.</p>\n<b>Watch the 30-second video below to see Oracle&#39;s Expense Bot in action.</b><iframe allow=\"autoplay ; fullscreen ;
